            My name is <span class="bold">Nikhil Srinivasan</span>, and I have been living in <span class="highlight">San Diego</span> for my entire life. I went to Pacific Trails Middle School and I am now at CCA. A thing I like specifically about San Diego are the beaches and trails. Every weekend, I go on a different hike with my parents and their friends, and one of my favorite hikes is the <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=torrey+pines+beach+trail+loop" target="_blank"> Torrey Pines Beach Trail Loop </a>. I enjoy the views of the beach and coastal shrub.

          <h3>Hobbies and Interests</h3>

            Some of my <span class="bold">hobbies</span> are spending time with my dad, hanging out with my friends, and playing tennis. When I spend time with my dad, I like gardening with him, and I play pickleball with him also. With my friends outside school, we usually go to watch a movie at <a href="https://www.cinepolisusa.com/delmar/theater-details/" target="_blank">Cinepolis</a> or play video games at one of our houses. Recently though, because most of my friends are in sophomore year, school has become more busy and we haven't been able to hang out as much as freshman year. In addition, I like playing <span class="highlight">tennis</span> with my friends and with my teammates on the 
            CCA tennis team.

          <h3>A Personal Experience</h3>

          <p>
            In APCSP, we covered the story of 
            <span class="underline">Dr. John Snow and the Broad Street Cholera Outbreak</span>, 
            where a single infected water pump on Broad Street in London caused over 600 people to die from cholera. This summer, I went to the UK, and visited London for 2 days. Before going to the UK for vacation, I had read the book <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ghost_Map" target="_blank">The Ghost Map</a>, a book about the heroes and people affected by the Broad Street Cholera Outbreak. When we went to London, I wanted to see the pump on Broad Street, and I did just that. At the pump, on the Broad Street corner, there was a pub called the John Snow Pub, named after <span class="bold">Dr. John Snow</span> â€” the man who identified the source of cholera in London using statistics and data science. Dr. John Snow is known today as one of the fathers of <span class="highlight">epidemiology and data science</span>. There were people sitting next to the pump drinking beer from the John Snow Pub, without any idea of the pump's history.
